Take a bowl
1 teaspoon instant yeast = 1.5 teaspoons active dry yeast = 3 teaspoons fresh yeast
Mix dry active yeast or fresh yeast and ½ teaspoon sugar in 1 cup lukewarm water. Set aside for 10 to 15 minutes or until the mixture has become frothy and bubbly
Mix with rest of the ingredients and knead to a soft dough.
Add 1 cup of water and mix well.
Next add 3 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 teaspoon of salt.
Add 3 tablespoons of olive oil, or preferred flavorless oil.
Plus add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice.
Use the hook attachment of the standing mixture on medium speed to combine the ingredients and bring the dough together.
You can also knead the pizza dough by hand. To do so just be sure to fully knead the dough for 8 to 10 minutes on a lightly floured surface.
The dough should be smooth, pliable and soft. If the dough looks dry, then you can add some water while kneading. If the dough seems sticky, sprinkle a bit of flour over the dough and continue to knead.
Cover the bowl with a lid or a kitchen towel, and allow to rise until the dough increases in volume and doubles up. This should take about 45 minutes to 1.5 hours, depending on the temperature of your kitchen.
If using dry active yeast, then keep covered for 1:30 hours to 3 hours (it depends on the temperature conditions in your city).
Below is a picture of my dough having doubled in size.
And here is the dough once I started to work with it again. It should be stringy with tiny air pockets. This texture is what creates that slightly chewy crust you want.
Knead the dough lightly again, and either use immediately or pack and store in the fridge or freezer.
Use a rolling pin to roll the dough ball into a flat circle, about 0.5 centimeter or ¼ inch thick. Flour the rolling pin if it sticks, or use a piece of parchment paper between the dough and rolling pin.
 Carefully lift and place the dough into the greased baking or tray.
 Next, spread on a thin layer of store bought or homemade pizza sauce. Leave a good bit of room around the edge of the dough clear for the crust.
 Add a generous sprinkling of vegetarian parmesan cheese 
 And top with lots of fresh mozzarella cheese. Spread out evenly, again, avoiding the very edge of the crust. Break fresh mozzarella cheese into chunks and place it on the crust.
  Bake the Margherita pizza for 10 to 15 minutes, until the cheese is completely melted and the crust is lightly golden in color.
  Now serve it!
